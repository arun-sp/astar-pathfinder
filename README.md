# A* Pathfinder
Path finding through a gridworld using repeated A* algorithm
* Compares the COmputational Time and Path Length for 3 types of agents agents
* * Agent 1 - Blindfolded. The agent can only learn about an obstacle by bumping into it.
* * Agent 2 - Can ‘see’ in 4 primary directions.
* * Agent 3 - Example inference agent. Can ‘sense’ the number of blocks in the 8 neighboring directions
